This project is a Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of rainfall patterns in India. It analyzes annual and monthly rainfall trends, handles missing values and outliers, and visualizes key insights using graphs like line plots, heatmaps, box plots, and pie charts. The analysis uses libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy to uncover patterns and relationships in the rainfall dataset.
